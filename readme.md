## Project Description
This project is a **web-based Master Timetable** for the **2024/2025 Academic Year**.  
It was created as part of the IYF Weekend Academy assignment and is implemented using **semantic HTML and CSS**.

The timetable displays the full school week (**Monday to Friday**) with all time slots, including **Form / Tutor’s Time**, lessons, breaks, lunch, and special sessions.
## Features
- Displays the timetable from **Monday to Friday**.  
- Includes the **Form / Tutor’s Time** column on the left.  
- Shows all scheduled lessons, breaks, lunch, and extracurricular activities.  
- Clean **black-and-white** design (no colored backgrounds).  
- Semantic HTML structure for readability and accessibility.  
- Responsive table layout that works on most screen sizes.

## Layout & Design
- Table headers (`<th>`) clearly mark **time slots** and **days**.  
- Rows represent days of the week, while columns represent periods.  
- **Breaks and Lunch** are shown in their respective slots as plain text.  
- Consistent font (Arial, sans-serif) for readability.  
- Black borders used for neat separation of cells.

## Accessibility
- Semantic use of `<table>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` for screen readers.  
- Black text on white background ensures **high contrast**.  
- Supports zooming without breaking layout.  
- Clear headers improve navigation for assistive technologies.
